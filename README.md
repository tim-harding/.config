# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles and configuration. Most of these are for my Arch Linux setup, but some also apply to cross-platform software, notably my Neovim and Fish configurations.

## Manual steps

# Firefox

Enable in about:config:

- media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled
- gfx.webrender.all
- gfx.webrender.compositor

# Chromium

In `chrome://flags`, set Preferred Ozone Platform to Wayland
